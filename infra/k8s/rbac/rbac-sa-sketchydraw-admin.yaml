# NOTES:
#Grants default ServiceAccount in the default namespace cluster-admin access.
#This is a broad, generic assignment â€” any pod not explicitly configured with a different ServiceAccount will inherit these permissions.
# Grants sa-sketchydraw ServiceAccount cluster-admin privileges.
# More explicit and scoped: this binding only affects pods using sa-sketchydraw.
