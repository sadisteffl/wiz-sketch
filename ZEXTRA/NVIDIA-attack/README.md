Automated Response: 
Automated Remediation for NVIDIAScape (CVE-2025-23266) on AWS
This repository contains a complete, event-driven, and serverless workflow to automatically detect and remediate the NVIDIAScape container escape vulnerability (CVE-2025-23266) in an Amazon EKS cluster using native AWS tools.

The solution uses Amazon Inspector for detection, Amazon EventBridge for alerting, and a custom AWS Lambda function to perform the remediation by reconfiguring the NVIDIA GPU Operator via Helm.

Architecture
The workflow follows a simple, event-driven pattern: Detect -> Alert -> Remediate.

How It Works
Detect: Amazon Inspector continuously scans the EKS cluster nodes. When it identifies a host with the vulnerable version of the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, it generates a CRITICAL finding for CVE-2025-23266.

Alert: An Amazon EventBridge rule is configured to specifically listen for this finding from Inspector. As soon as the finding is generated, the rule is triggered.

Remediate: The EventBridge rule's target is an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function is packaged as a container image with kubectl, helm, and a remediation script. It receives the event, authenticates to the EKS cluster, and executes a helm upgrade command to reconfigure the NVIDIA GPU Operator, effectively mitigating the vulnerability across the entire cluster.

Deployment Instructions
Follow these steps to deploy the automated remediation workflow.

Step 1: Build and Push the Lambda Container Image
The Lambda function requires kubectl and helm, so it must be packaged as a container image.

Clone this repository.

Authenticate your Docker client to Amazon ECR.

Create a new ECR repository (e.g., nvidiascape-remediator).

Build and push the image:

docker build -t nvidiascape-remediator .
docker tag nvidiascape-remediator:latest <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/nvidiascape-remediator:latest
docker push <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/nvidiascape-remediator:latest

Step 2: Create the Lambda Execution Role
The Lambda function needs permissions to interact with EKS.

Go to the IAM console and create a new role.

Select AWS service and Lambda as the use case.

Attach the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole managed policy.

Create and attach a new inline policy to allow the Lambda to describe the EKS cluster:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "eks:DescribeCluster",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:eks:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:cluster/<YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME>"
        }
    ]
}

Note the ARN of the created role.

Step 3: Deploy the Lambda Function
Go to the AWS Lambda console and create a new function.

Select Container image as the type.

Provide a function name (e.g., NVIDIAScape-Remediator).

Browse for your ECR image pushed in Step 1.

Under Permissions, attach the IAM role created in Step 2.

In the Configuration tab, set the following Environment Variables:

EKS_CLUSTER_NAME: The name of your EKS cluster.

HELM_NAMESPACE: The namespace of your GPU Operator (e.g., nvidia).

HELM_RELEASE: The release name of the GPU Operator (e.g., gpu-operator).

REMEDIATION_MODE: Set to mitigate for the immediate fix.

Increase the function Timeout to 1 minute.

Step 4: Grant Lambda Access to EKS
The Lambda role needs to be authorized to perform actions inside the cluster.

Edit the aws-auth ConfigMap in your cluster:

kubectl edit -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth

Add the Lambda's execution role ARN to the mapRoles section. Grant it system:masters for simplicity in this demo, but use a more restrictive role in production.

mapRoles: |
  - rolearn: <ARN_OF_YOUR_LAMBDA_ROLE_FROM_STEP_2>
    username: lambda-remediator:{{SessionName}}
    groups:
      - system:masters

Step 5: Create the EventBridge Rule
This rule will trigger the Lambda function.

Go to the Amazon EventBridge console and create a new rule.

Give it a name (e.g., NVIDIAScape-Inspector-Finding-Rule).

In the Event pattern section, select Custom pattern and enter the following JSON:

{
  "source": ["aws.inspector2"],
  "detail-type": ["Inspector2 Finding"],
  "detail": {
    "severity": ["CRITICAL"],
    "vulnerabilityId": ["CVE-2025-23266"]
  }
}

In the Target section, select AWS Lambda and choose the NVIDIAScape-Remediator function created in Step 3.

Create the rule.

Usage
The workflow is now fully automated. Once Amazon Inspector is enabled and generates a finding for CVE-2025-23266, the entire remediation chain will execute automatically.

You can monitor the process by checking the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function, which will show the output of the remediation script.
